# CopyRig

Simple copy Rig to Auto Rig Pro reference rig. Applies position and scale of the known bones of an imported rig to a the auto rig pro reference rig.

## Usage
Apply pos, rot, scale to everything. ;-) Select the iported rig, go to edit mode, press copy. Select the reference rig, go to edit mode, press paste. 

## Limitation
- The code is probably horrible - it is my first blender addon and actually my first >10 lines python program.
- The only supported import rig right now is the makehuman game engine rig.
